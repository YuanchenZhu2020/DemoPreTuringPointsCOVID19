Description: In the paper <Tracking_and_forecasting_milepost_moments_of_the_
  epidemic_in_the_early_outbreak__framework_and_applications_to_the_COVID_19>, 
  we proposed a method to predict "turning points", whose main idea is 
  using the change velocity of infection rate (InfectionRateVelocity) and
  the change velocity of completion rate(RemovedRateVelocity) to forcast 
  newly diagnoses cases and number of cases treated in the hospital in the 
  future. Here, we proposed one of the algorithms to calculate the 
  change rate and then make the prediction, which is the method we used 
  in our paper mentioned above. At last, we offer a simple example to 
  implement this method.
